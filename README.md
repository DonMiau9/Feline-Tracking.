**What Feline Tracking:**

* Captures the screen and lets you mark points for tracking using template matching (OpenCV).
* Converts movement or distance into normalized values (0–100 / 0–1000) and sends them via serial to ESP32 devices or an emulator mode.
* Features a modern PySide6 interface with controls for sensitivity, range, and presets for known devices.
* Records data in Funscript format (ready for export).
